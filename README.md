### Hi there 

I'm Alex Nesovic. Worked first in tech consulting at Accenture Technology, then worked for the Capital Market division of Deloitte Luxemboug (Alternative Investments sub-division) as a Financial Software Engineer (Python, Flask, JS).Now, working for Amundi Asset Management (technology division) as a tech support for the front-office and middle-office side of our client's operations. My job consists mainly about implementing our client's (private funds and institutional) demands in Amundi's proprietary's Portfolio Management System (ALTO), through some JEP (a Java's derived language, Python and SQL to query some Sybase DBs).

The main side project I am working on is https://www.financial-portfolio.io/
WebApp currently off the grid but demo available locally if you're interested through a call.

This project gives an overview of my capabilities and interests.

<b>Financial-portfolio.io (AWS cloud-native) is: </b>
1. An autonomous market data feeder powered by Python, Jenkins/Cron and Linux. A stock market data platform accessible via a own developed front-end.
2. An autonomous signals detector

<b>Development performed on FP: </b>

<b>Second Phase:</b> <br> (**!! The code of the commercial and extended version is private, let's get in touch if you'd like to know more !!**)
- Currently migrating the project from Flask/JS (+AJAX, Jquery) to a Django/React tech stack
- Setting up Redux to manage the global state

<b>First Phase:</b> <br>
- Deployed the app (Python Flask application) to the web & the cloud (AWS Route 53, Beanstalk & Docker)
- Implemented the automated & scheduled web crawlers to scan the American stock market on a daily basis (Python Selenium + Jenkins on Linux AWS EC2 VMs)
- Coded the automated technical analysis algorithms (Python)
- Coded the front-end (JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
- Coded the middleware (AJAX calls <-> Flask API)
- User authentication procedure developement
- AWS RDS MySQL setup 
- Connection to different market data API's

Code (first phase): https://github.com/alexnesov/Financial-portfolio-io-advanced-Flask

## Languages:
- <img alt="Python" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white"/> (my strong point, using it daily in a professional (Accenture, Deloitte, Axa, Clearstream) and personnal context, since 4 years almost)
- <img alt="JS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black"/> (medium level, able to build interesting plain vanilla JS apps, and also with JQuery and AJAX)
- <img alt="cpp" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white"/> (basics, learned it to at least know a faster language and get closer to the machine, also important in quant finance and algo trading, as I am preparing the Certifcate in Quant Finance (CQF))
- <img alt="java" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white"/> (basics)
- My new thing is to learn Lisp as it's totally different than anything I learned

## Front-end scripting:
- <img alt="HTML" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white"/>
- <img alt="CSS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-239120?&style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white"/>

- <img alt="Django" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=green"/> (new on this, but the overall Web logic is the same as for Flask, it's basically Flask on steroids)
- <img alt="Django-REST" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DJANGO-REST-ff1709?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white&color=ff1709&labelColor=gray"/>

- Usage of JSON, AJAX, JQuery, REST

<b>Cloud: </b>

- <img alt="aws" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_AWS-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white"/>
(Daily usage of EC2, Lambda, S3, Beanstalk, Route 53, familiar with IAM, used API Gateway and SES combined to allow contact form capabilities to a static S3 website also) 
- <img alt="Azure" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/microsoft%20azure-0089D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-azure&logoColor=white"/>

<b>Other stuff: </b>

- Cron, SSH, Git, daily usage of linux command line
