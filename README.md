### Hi there 

**I'm Alex Nesovic. Worked first in tech consulting at Accenture Technology, then worked for the Capital Market division of Deloitte Luxemboug (Alternative Investments sub-division) as a Senior Consultant (Software Engineer with Python, Flask, JS). Worked also for Amundi Asset Management (technology division) as a tech consultant for the front-office and middle-office side of their client's operations.**

WebApp currently off the grid but demo available locally if you're interested through a call.

This project gives an overview of my capabilities (full-stack, from server setup on the back end, though front-end design, to cloud deployment with Docker and routing for public avilability).

<b>Financial-portfolio.io (AWS cloud-native) is: </b>
1. An autonomous market data feeder powered by Python, Jenkins/Cron and Linux. A stock market data platform accessible via a own developed front-end.
2. An autonomous signals detector

<b>Development performed on FP: </b>

<b>Second Phase:</b> <br> (**!! The code of the commercial and extended version is private, let's get in touch if you'd like to know more !!**)
- Currently migrating the project from Flask/JS (+AJAX, Jquery) to a Django/React tech stack
- Setting up Redux to manage the global state

<b>First Phase:</b> <br>
- Deployed the app (Python Flask application) to the web & the cloud (AWS Route 53, Beanstalk & Docker)
- Implemented the automated & scheduled web crawlers to scan the American stock market on a daily basis (Python Selenium + Jenkins on Linux AWS EC2 VMs)
- Coded the automated technical analysis algorithms (Python)
- Coded the front-end (JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
- Coded the middleware (AJAX calls <-> Flask API)
- User authentication procedure developement
- AWS RDS MySQL setup 
- Connection to different market data API's

Code (first phase): https://github.com/alexnesov/Financial-portfolio-io-advanced-Flask

## Languages
- <img alt="Python" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white"/> (my strong point, using it daily in a professional (Accenture, Deloitte, Axa, Clearstream) and personnal context, since 4 years almost)
- <img alt="JS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black"/> (medium level, able to build interesting plain vanilla JS apps, and also with JQuery and AJAX)
- <img alt="cpp" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white"/> (basics)
- <img alt="java" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white"/> (basics)
- <img alt="C" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white"/> (basics, currently ilmplementing some Neural Network from scratch with it)


## DB's
- <img alt="sqlite" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-07405E?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white"/>
- <img alt="mysql" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-00000F?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white"/>

## Web

### Servers & API's
- <img alt="flask" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white"/> (using it daily)
- <img alt="Django" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=green"/>
- <img alt="Django-REST" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/DJANGO-REST-ff1709?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white&color=ff1709&labelColor=gray"/>
- Using Postman and exporting the JSON format configs for API documentation. Used Swagger also a bit.

### Front-end & Middleware
- <img alt="HTML" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white"/>
- <img alt="CSS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-239120?&style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white"/>
- <img alt="Bootstrap" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Bootstrap-563D7C?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white"/>
- <img alt="react" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB"/> (relatively new on React, but already migrated a big chunk of financial-portfolio.io project towards it, therefore some nice automatisms start to arise, with Django on the backend)
- <img alt="redux" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Redux-593D88?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=white"/> 
- Used AJAX with vanilla JS before, JQuery also, but currently using REST arch with JSON, daily, in the context of React developments

## Cloud

   
- <img alt="aws" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon_AWS-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white"/>
- Daily usage of EC2 (SSHing through Tmux through my Linux personal computer)
- Lambda (used it as Node.js service based to receive user trigger emailing capabilities from a JS static webpage, returns a OK/KO message to static website)
- Combination of AWS API Gateway service with SES (AWS email service) to allow contact Form capabilities within an otherwise static S3 website
- RDS (for MySQL community)
- S3 (stored a static website on it, and using it to store app uploaded user images instead of storing them on a MySQL "traditional" DB --> would be a bad practice)
- Beanstalk (for deploying Docker containers)
- Route 53 (used it to buy several domains and manage HTTP/HTTPS routings)
- IAM (access control when I was collaborating with other users)
- EventBridge (implented "rules" to turn ON/OFF my EC2 instance on schedule, to reduce costs)


<br>

- <img alt="Azure" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/microsoft%20azure-0089D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoft-azure&logoColor=white"/>
(Microsoft Azure certified + experience with Databricks --> used py Koalas in the context of a Spark cluster)

## Other stuff

- Cron, SSH, Git, daily usage of linux command line


<b>Workflow and agility: </b>
- <img alt="Docker" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white"/>
- <img alt="Jenkins" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Jenkins-D24939?style=for-the-badge&logo=Jenkins&logoColor=white"/> (using it as a nice Linux Cron, to orchestrate my autonomous python jobs on EC2)


<b>OS': </b>
- <img alt="MS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white"/> (the main OS I'm using)
